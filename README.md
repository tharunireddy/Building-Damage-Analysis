# Building-Damage-Analysis
The purpose of the research is to analyze how severely a building is damaged, depending on various aspects such as it's location, age and the materials used to construct the house. The development of a predictive algorithm could help design and build buildings in seismically fragile areas, saving lives and minimizing the damage caused by earthquakes.
The aim of the project is to predict the ordinal variable 'damage_grade' which represents the severity of damage to buildings in the event of an earthquake. There are 3 types:
1 - represents a low damage
2 - represents a medium damage
3 - represents almost complete destruction
The dataset contains 260601 rows and 40 columns with building id as unique and random identifier. The dataset contains information on building location, age and material used for construction.
